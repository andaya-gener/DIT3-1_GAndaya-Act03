# Activity 3 Short Reflection

## What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?
I used a simple layout with a centered profile picture, name, and short bio to create a balanced and organized appearance. The blue accent color on the button adds emphasis without being too flashy. The fonts and spacing were chosen for easy readability.

## How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?
I made sure to use proper text sizes (`sp`) and consistent spacing (`dp`) for better readability. A content description was added to the profile image for accessibility support. The layout is responsive and adjusts properly in both portrait and landscape orientations.

## What would you improve if this were a real app?
If this were a real app, I would add features like editing the profile, changing the profile picture, and integrating social media links or contact details.
